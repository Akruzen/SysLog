This is a simple application that takes the system logs via dmesg and logcat,
and saves them to the primary external storage under SysLog/{Date-Time}, compresses them, and lets you upload/email them.
<br /><br />
Root access is <b>required</b> for 4.1+ to access the full logs, and in some cases for kernel logs.
